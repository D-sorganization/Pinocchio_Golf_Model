        Analysis of file format (from probe):
        - Binary format with mixed ASCII/Wide-char strings.
        - Contains 'Skeleton' header.
        - Contains marker names like 'WaistLeft', 'WaistRight', 'HeadTop'.
        - Data appears to be float32 or float64 streams interleaved or following headers.
        
        Currently this parser is a STUB. Full reverse engineering of the binary 
        layout is required, or a vendor DLL.

            Dictionary with 'markers' (Dict[str, array]).
